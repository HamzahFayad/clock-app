![Design preview for the Clock app coding challenge](/src/assets/preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this clock application and get it looking as close to the design as possible using following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) to set the city and country underneath the time
- [Quotes API](https://api.quotable.io/random/) to generate random quotes.

## Users

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote
